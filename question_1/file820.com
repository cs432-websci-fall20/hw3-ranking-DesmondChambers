This past February, Google released a&lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B8hEnEyF0mZ/\"&gt; thought-provoking commercial&lt;/a&gt; during the Super Bowl, highlighting their most searched public figures, events, and notable moments- and they were all Black. TikTok has also joined in on the movement, and spent every day in February unveiling a collection of Black History Month stickers for creators to tag to their videos to showcase their pride, support, and love for the app's diverse and global community. Additionally, the video-sharing social networking platform hosted its first-ever Black Creator Summit last month, hosting 100 top and emerging Black TikTok creators for sessions and panels on content creation, career development, personal branding.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Facebook has empowered Black culture not only in February but all the other days in the year. Through its &lt;a href=\"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shareblackstories-on-instagram\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;#ShareBlackStories&lt;/a&gt; initiative, Instagram employees at Facebook are telling stories about Black culture and impact in the world, in the office and on the platform itself. Through the hashtag, users can sift through content produced by incredible creators and take advantage of new creative tools like culturally inspired camera effects and custom templates. Instagram is also collaborating with BET through its #Advocates IGTV Content Series, showcasing a four-part series of stories from Black creators making an impact in the creative space. Facebook believes one way to keep up with the impact year-round is through employment and business opportunities for Black artists. The company utilized the talent of designer &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/laolunyc/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Laolu Senbanjo&lt;/a&gt; for Instagram AR Effects and photography from &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ruffdraft/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Brandon Ruffin&lt;/a&gt; for the Black@Instagram Employee Spotlight.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;We at ONE37pm wanted to learn more about the impact and importance behind these initiatives at Facebook and Instagram, so we went straight to the team to learn more.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n","dropCase":null,"button":{"text":null,"url":null}}},{"type":"sub-head","data":"Brooke DeVard Ozaydinli, Product Marketing Manager"},{"type":"large-image","data":{"imageSrc":"https://one37pm.imgix.net/one37pm-editor-dev-images/s3fs-public/user-images/2020-03/Brooke.jpg","imageUrl":null,"credit":"Brandon Ruffin // @ruffdraft","creditUrl":null,"caption":null,"hed":null,"subhed":null,"bodyText":"&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Ozaydinli is based in the New York City office, working with next-gen creators on IGTV.

She’s constantly deconstructing what it means to be a young Black woman in today’s society and breaking down privilege as it relates to beauty, sexual orientation, colorism and more. She’s a radical thinker and a joy to follow.

I believe that happens through exposure, experience, and empathy which ultimately manifests through wanting to understand Black communities on a deep, meaningful level - not a superficial one.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it so important for a viral platform like Instagram to highlight Black creators and excellence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In America, part of our struggle has been having the creativity and excellence of the black community seen and acknowledged. Whether it be television and movie studios, publishing, music labels, art galleries, or academia, our creativity has been filtered by established systems that have been slow to embrace ideas outside of their familiarity. But with a platform like Instagram, that help democratize content, those systems can be bypassed. And black creativity and excellence can be, and should be,&nbsp; seen, shared, and celebrated&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other hashtags do you like searching on Instagram to locate Black stories, talent, and excellence? Any other accounts people should search/follow?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;I follow black writers, actors, comedians, and directors who strive to bring the stories of the American Black experience to their followers and community. I tend to focus on media mavens like Issa Rae, Lena Waithe, Amanda Seales and Elaine Welteroth, who have found inspiring ways to integrate their stories into their craft.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On what resilience means to her:&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“The unfortunate truth is that our history includes pain, ugliness, and oppression. But as we acknowledge the negative parts, it's important to also acknowledge the positive attributes that enabled us to overcome them.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n","sponsored":null,"button":{"text":null,"url":null}}},{"type":"related-module","data":{"sectionHed":null,"articles":[{"imageSrc":"https://one37pm.imgix.net/one37pm-editor-dev-images/s3fs-public/user-images/2020-03/BLK-and-BOLD-coffee-uni.jpg","hed":"We

This past February, Google released a<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B8hEnEyF0mZ/"> thought-provoking commercial</a> during the Super Bowl, highlighting their most searched public figures, events, and notable moments- and they were all Black. TikTok has also joined in on the movement, and spent every day in February unveiling a collection of Black History Month stickers for creators to tag to their videos to showcase their pride, support, and love for the app's diverse and global community. Additionally, the video-sharing social networking platform hosted its first-ever Black Creator Summit last month, hosting 100 top and emerging Black TikTok creators for sessions and panels on content creation, career development, personal branding.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Facebook has empowered Black culture not only in February but all the other days in the year. Through its <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shareblackstories-on-instagram" target="_blank">#ShareBlackStories</a> initiative, Instagram employees at Facebook are telling stories about Black culture and impact in the world, in the office and on the platform itself. Through the hashtag, users can sift through content produced by incredible creators and take advantage of new creative tools like culturally inspired camera effects and custom templates. Instagram is also collaborating with BET through its #Advocates IGTV Content Series, showcasing a four-part series of stories from Black creators making an impact in the creative space. Facebook believes one way to keep up with the impact year-round is through employment and business opportunities for Black artists. The company utilized the talent of designer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/laolunyc/" target="_blank">Laolu Senbanjo</a> for Instagram AR Effects and photography from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ruffdraft/" target="_blank">Brandon Ruffin</a> for the Black@Instagram Employee Spotlight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">We at ONE37pm wanted to learn more about the impact and importance behind these initiatives at Facebook and Instagram, so we went straight to the team to learn more.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>How do you #ShareBlackStories at Instagram?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">So many of the trends emerging on Instagram come from young, talented Black creators. A lot of the work I’m focused on is asking how we can empower the next generation of creators on the platform. Through accounts like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/creators/" target="_blank">@creators</a>, we strive to represent Black creators but also to inspire them and give them the tips and insights to turn their passion into a business.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What do you hope to see change in the marketing space regarding Black representation?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Representation in front of the camera is great, but we need more Black representation behind the scenes making decisions, from product development, art direction, design and marketing. We’ve moved past simply showing diversity—we’re at [the] space now where it’s imperative that diversity is reflected across the teams.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why is it so important for a viral platform like Instagram to highlight Black creators and excellence?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Because black creators are the originators and leaders of so many of Instagram’s largest trends. Instagram would look very different today if it weren’t for black creators.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What other hashtags do you like searching on Instagram to locate Black stories, talent and excellence? Any other accounts people should search/follow?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">#BrownUpYourFeed—this is an amazing hashtag created by artist and deep thinker Mandy Harris Williams who everyone should absolutely follow @idealblackfemale. She’s constantly deconstructing what it means to be a young Black woman in today’s society and breaking down privilege as it relates to beauty, sexual orientation, colorism and more. She’s a radical thinker and a joy to follow. And if you want a daily dose of joy, you must follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rickeythompson/" target="_blank">Rickey Thompson</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/redcarpetgirlz/" target="_blank">ZaZa</a>—it’s impossible not to smile when these two pop up on my feed.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>How do you #ShareBlackStories at Instagram?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">We came up with the idea to galvanize our passionate Black employees and create a program that uplifted the Black community, highlighted the amazing things the Black community does while also encouraging the Black community to share their own stories.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why is it so important for a viral platform like Instagram to highlight Black creators and excellence?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">It’s important to shine a light on the communities where many of the trends we see coming to the mainstream originate from. We reach a lot of people with our platforms at Instagram and Facebook, so it’s especially important for us to be mindful of highlighting the history and people behind the creative moments that we see reflected in pop culture because these spaces are where these trends tend to proliferate and, to borrow a phrase from my coworker, move from “the ‘hood’ to the suburbs.” Shining a focused light on Black culture reminds us of the places where the things that become incredibly popular are invented, created and originate from.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What do you hope to see change in the marketing space regarding Black representation?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">We’ve made a lot of strides in recent years when it comes to positive portrayals in marketing, so it would be wonderful to see that momentum continue.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>On sharing Black stories:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Sharing our stories reminds us and others of the value we bring to society. It’s the foundation on which we build bridges to connect us all.”</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>How do you #ShareBlackStories at Instagram?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">I come from Ghana, where passing stories from generation to generation is an essential part of the cultural DNA. As a researcher, my job is to listen to people’s stories and make sure that they’re heard. In telling these stories, and telling them well, I am sharing the cumulative stories that make me who I am.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why is #ShareBlackStories important in a corporate space like Facebook and Instagram? </strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">When you look around the Bay Area and Silicon Valley, you don’t really see US, despite the fact that Black people drive a considerable amount of social media consumption and engagement. I once heard a speaker say that we develop tools for ourselves. Without the empathy for and comprehension of the people using these tools, then we’re effectively leaving them out of the experience. The more of US that are here at Facebook and Instagram, the more perspective we can bring to the development process and ensure that we are included.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why is #ShareBlackStories important in a corporate space like Facebook and Instagram?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">I think #ShareBlackStories is important because we have so much reach at our company, and there are so many smart people working here making important business and product decisions.

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Like most corporations, we all come in with unconscious bias, including those that negatively impact black people.

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Two changes continue to be top of mind for me, the first is equal representation of Black women and men in leadership positions, especially at the mid-management level. The second would be a final abolishing of stereotypes and tropes of black characters in marketing content.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What do you hope to see change in the marketing space regarding Black representation?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">I would like marketers to stop stereotyping the Black community when they are trying to sell/market a product. The Black experience is so complex, diverse and intricate and marketing often fails to acknowledge and represent that.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why is it so important for a viral platform like Instagram to highlight Black creators and excellence?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Black creators shape culture. As a platform that presents content and culture to consumers, it is important to acknowledge the “hitmakers” (memes, gifs, dances, phrases, etc.) on the platform, which oftentimes are Black creators.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">I'm often sharing IG posts or stories that highlight the beauty, hardships, and humor of the black experience with my friends and family. The #ShareBlackStories initiative was important because it shed light on communities, and engagements, that are a significant part of Instagram but can be completely unseen by people who aren’t a part of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why is #ShareBlackStories important in a corporate space like Facebook and Instagram?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">I think the more we create an office environment that strives to understand, and empathize with, the experience of black communities, the more that understanding and empathy will be reflected in our product and our users' experiences.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What do you hope to see change in the marketing space regarding Black representation?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">I hope to see an expansion of black representation. But in order for there to be an expansion in Black representation, there has to be an expansion of comprehension. I believe that happens through exposure, experience, and empathy which ultimately manifests through wanting to understand Black communities on a deep, meaningful level - not a superficial one.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why is it so important for a viral platform like Instagram to highlight Black creators and excellence?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">In America, part of our struggle has been having the creativity and excellence of the black community seen and acknowledged. Whether it be television and movie studios, publishing, music labels, art galleries, or academia, our creativity has been filtered by established systems that have been slow to embrace ideas outside of their familiarity. But with a platform like Instagram, that help democratize content, those systems can be bypassed. And black creativity and excellence can be, and should be,&nbsp; seen, shared, and celebrated&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What other hashtags do you like searching on Instagram to locate Black stories, talent, and excellence? Any other accounts people should search/follow?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">I follow black writers, actors, comedians, and directors who strive to bring the stories of the American Black experience to their followers and community. I tend to focus on media mavens like Issa Rae, Lena Waithe, Amanda Seales and Elaine Welteroth, who have found inspiring ways to integrate their stories into their craft.</p>
