When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, not 7.5 million people contracted the swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu."</p><p>FACT CHECK: While Pence is correct that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the 2009 swine flu pandemic infected an estimated 60.8 million Americans in its first year, it is misleading to compare the two outbreaks given H1N1's far lower fatality rate, and similarly misleading to call the Obama administration's response a "failure."</p><p>The CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html" target="_blank">estimates</a> up to 575,000 lives were lost to the swine flu worldwide. Of those, fewer than 13,000 were American, due in part to the Obama administration's "complex, multi-faceted and long-term response," the CDC later <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/cdcresponse.htm#CDC_Communication_Activities" target="_blank">wrote</a>. Thus far, COVID-19 has taken the lives of over 210,000 Americans, a little over eight months since the first known case of the virus was discovered in the United States.</p><p>"The team, in my opinion, in 2009, really demonstrated that the planning was worth it. Nothing is ever perfect. But I felt just so impressed and so proud of the job CDC did in 2009," Dr. Julie Gerberding, a CDC director during the George W. Bush administration, told ABC News.</p><div data-box-type="fitt-adbox-incontentTeads2"><div class="Ad incontentTeads2 incontentTeads2--story ad-slot" data-slot-type="incontentTeads2" data-collapse-before-load="true" data-slot-kvps="tag=news-politics,objid=73464669,pgn=politics,pgtyp=story,lang=en,sp=abcnews,programmatic=true,bundleId=com.abcnews,level=undefined,pos=incontentTeads2"></div></div><p><em>--John Verhovek and Lucien Bruggeman</em></p><div><div class="CalloutLink"><div class="CalloutLink-item"><span><svg class="icon__svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><use xlink:href="#icon__plus"></use></svg></span><a class="AnchorLink CalloutLink-text" tabindex="0" data-track-moduleofclick="Callout" data-track-position="2" data-track-ctatext="MORE-Experts-express-concerns-about-possible-coronavirus-transmission-at-vice-president-debate" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/experts-express-concerns-coronavirus-transmission-vice-president-debate/story?id=73451239">MORE: Experts express concerns about possible coronavirus transmission at vice president debate</a></div></div></div><h3>Pence overstates China travel restrictions</h3><div><aside class="InlineElement InlineElement--desktop InlineImage"><div class="ScrollSpy_container"><span></span></div><figure class="Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image"><div class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></div><div class="Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative"><picture><source srcSet="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" media="(max-width: 767px)"/><source srcSet="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" media="(max-width: 413px)"/><img class="" alt="PHOTO: Vice President Mike Pence speaks during the vice presidential debate in Kingsbury Hall at the University of Utah, Oct. 7, 2020, in Salt Lake City." data-mptype="image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></picture></div><figcaption><div class="Caption__Wrapper"><div class="Caption"><div class="Caption__Meta Caption__Meta--flex"><img class="Image Logo Caption__Logo Logo__xs" alt="Eric Baradat/AFP via Getty Images" data-mptype="image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/><span class="RichText Caption__Meta__Text">Eric Baradat/AFP via Getty Images</span></div><div class="Caption__TextWrapper"><div class="Caption__Text" aria-labelledby="Caption__ScreenReaderText"><span class="Truncate Truncate--collapsed"><span><span class="RichText">Vice President Mike Pence speaks during the vice presidential debate in Kingsbury Hall at the University of Utah, Oct. 7, 2020, in Salt Lake City.</span></span></span></div></div><span id="Caption__ScreenReaderText" aria-hidden="true">Vice President Mike Pence speaks during the vice presidential debate in Kingsbury Hall at the University of Utah, Oct. 7, 2020, in Salt Lake City.</span></div></div></figcaption></figure></aside></div><p id="_ap_link_Donald Trump_DonaldTrump_">PENCE'S CLAIM: "Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/donald-trump" id="_ap_link_Donald Trump_DonaldTrump_" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> did what no other American president had ever done. And that was, he suspended all travel from China, the second-largest economy in the world."</p><p>FACT CHECK: At the end of January, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation to restrict travelers who had visited China in the previous 14 days from entering the United States, but it was more narrow than Pence described. The orders did not apply to U.S. citizens, green card holders and their close family members. Health care workers were also exempt.</p><p>Nearly 760,000 people entered the U.S. from China between December of last year and February, according to an ABC News review of traveler data.</p><p>Restrictions on travelers from Europe started in March.

Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.</p><p>Public health experts have repeatedly advised against indoor events, which has found renewed importance in light of recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance advising that the virus can spread beyond 6 feet indoors.</p><p>Even for outdoor events, public health experts encourage wearing masks and maintaining 6 feet of distance from others. The Rose Garden event did not follow either of these social distancing norms; chairs were not spaced out, few guests opted to wear masks and guests hugged and shook hands.</p><p>The coronavirus outbreak has infected "34 White House staffers and other contacts" in recent days, according to an internal government memo, an indication that the disease has spread among more people than previously known in the seat of American government, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/34-people-connected-white-house-previously-infected-coronavirus/story?id=73487381" target="_blank">according to an ABC News report</a>.</p><p><em>--Olivia Rubin and Leah Croll</em></p><div><aside class="InlineElement InlineElement--desktop InlineImage"><div class="ScrollSpy_container"><span></span></div><figure class="Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image"><div class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></div><div class="Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative"><picture><source srcSet="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" media="(max-width: 767px)"/><source srcSet="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" media="(max-width: 413px)"/><img class="" alt="PHOTO: Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen.

We're going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we've already added back 11.6 million jobs."</p><p>FACT CHECK: With September's <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf" target="_blank">jobs report</a>, over 11.4 million jobs have been added since March. But job gains have slowed in the past three months, showing the recovery is starting to lose momentum.</p><p>In September, 661,000 jobs were added, which was worse than expectations.

Both in terms of health records, but also let's look at taxes. We now know because of great investigative journalism that Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. When I first heard about it, I literally said, you mean $750,000? And it was like, no, $750. We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million."</p><p>PENCE'S CLAIM: "The president said those public reports are not accurate and the president's also released literally stacks of financial disclosures the American people can review just as the law allows."</p><p>FACT CHECK: As a presidential candidate in 2016 and as a sitting president since, Donald Trump has released annual financial disclosure reports filed to the Federal Election Commission and the Office of Government Ethics, as required by federal laws. Trump's annual personal financial records, which are nearly 100 pages each, show his source of income, other assets, as well as liabilities.</p><p>Trump, however, has not released his personal tax records, which is not required by law but has been a decades-long tradition that has been followed by his predecessors in the White House.</p><p>Biden and Harris have differentiated themselves from Trump by releasing their federal and state tax returns -- most recently just last week, showing Biden and his wife paid roughly $290,000 in taxes to the federal government in 2019, and Harris and her husband paid about $1.2 million in federal and state taxes last year.</p><p>Harris' claim that Trump paid just $750 in taxes comes from The New York Times' recent report. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html" target="_blank">According to the Times</a>, Trump's tax records show that he paid just $750 in federal income taxes the year he ran for president and his first year in the White House.</p><p>The report also stated that Trump is personally responsible for loans and other debts totaling $421 million, "with most of it coming due within four years."</p><p><em>--Soo Rin Kim</em></p><h3>Pence claims that Biden and Harris want to ban fracking -- but it's complicated</h3><p>PENCE'S CLAIM: "They want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking, which would cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs all across the heartland."</p><p>HARRIS' RESPONSE: "I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking."</p><p>FACT CHECK: While Harris did support banning fracking as a presidential candidate, she has since fallen in line with Biden, who does not want to ban fracking.</p><p>Biden has said that he doesn't want to add new fracking on public lands. He wants to move away from fracking to eventually get net-zero emissions. He has also argued that a transition to clean energy is necessary to keep people employed.</p><p>Biden's <a href="https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/" target="_blank">environmental plan</a> calls for an end to fossil fuel subsidies and for a massive investment in clean energy, including training fossil fuel workers for clean energy jobs.</p><p>During an address in August, Biden said, "I am not banning fracking.

I am not banning fracking, no matter how many times Donald Trump lies about me."</p><p>In July 2019, Biden was asked during a <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1907/31/se.02.html" target="_blank">CNN debate</a> if there would be a place for fossil fuels, like coal and fracking, in a Biden administration.

However, the national 7-day average of coronavirus tests has yet to surpass 1 million, according to the <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/us-daily-tests" target="_blank">COVID Tracking Project</a>.</p><p>To date, the U.S. has conducted over 120 million COVID-19 tests, according to the <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#testing_testsperformed" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p><p>More testing will, of course, identify more cases.</p><p>However, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, there are several countries that have conducted more testing per capita than the U.S., but also have fewer cases per capita than the U.S. does -- such as the U.K., Spain and the United Arab Emirates. Those figures reflect all-time averages of daily tests conducted per capita -- and the daily percentage of tests that come back positive, which is known as the "positivity rate" or the "percent positive rate."</p><p>Despite having one of the highest rates of tests per capita, the U.S. faces the largest outbreak in the world and new cases continue to trend upward in many states. The percent positivity in the U.S. remains over 4.7%, when other countries with high testing figures report a significantly lower percent positivity rate, according to Johns Hopkins.</p><p>Meanwhile, the shortages of PPE and testing supplies are due to high global demand and the fact the domestic production of supplies is limited. According to the Government Accountability Office, "testing supply shortages have contributed to delays in turnaround times for testing results.</p><p>"Delays in processing test results have multiple serious consequences, including delays in isolating those who test positive and tracing their contacts in a timely manner, which can in turn exacerbate outbreaks by allowing the virus to spread undetected," the report read.</p><p><em>--Arielle Mitropoulos</em></p><h3>Pence says Biden called China travel restrictions 'xenophobic,' but that's not clear</h3><p>PENCE'S CLAIM: "[Trump] suspended all travel from China, the second-largest economy in the world. Now, senator, Joe Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical."</p><p>FACT CHECK: While Pence has claimed that Biden opposed his decision to ban most travel from China at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic and that he called the restrictions "xenophobic," the former vice president did not explicitly weigh in on the decision when it was announced on Jan. 31. He did, however, call the president xenophobic minutes after the partial travel ban was announced.</p><p>During a campaign event that same day in Fort Madison, Iowa, Biden discussed the growing concern over the COVID-19 outbreak and cautioned that Trump should let science "lead the way."</p><p>"In moments like this, this is where the credibility of a president is most needed as he explains what we should and should not do," Biden told the crowd at the event. "This is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysterical xenophobia ... and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science."</p><p>The comments came just minutes after the White House announcement, so it was unclear if Biden was referring to the decision specifically, but the former vice president did tweet a similar sentiment the next day.</p><p>"We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus," Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/joebiden/status/1223727977361338370" target="_blank">posted</a>. "We need to lead the way with science -- not Donald Trump's record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency."</p><p>Throughout March, Biden used the word "xenophobic" in various speeches and tweets to criticize the president's labeling COVID-19 the "China virus.</p><p>Biden did acknowledge in a March speech the travel restrictions put in place by the Trump administration, noting they "may" slow the spread.</p><p>"Banning all travel from Europe or any other part of the world may slow it, but as we've seen, it will not stop it. And travel restrictions based on favoritism and politics rather than risk will be counterproductive," Biden said.</p><p>Biden's campaign did not explicitly discuss the vice president's view of the ban until April.</p><p>"Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials and backed by a full strategy," Biden's deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/politics/joe-biden-trump-china-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">told CNN</a>.

Harris is denying the fact that they're going to raise taxes on every American.”</p><p>FACT CHECK: Biden has insisted that his administration would only seek to raise taxes on companies and individuals making more than $400,000 a year. Tax experts largely agree that under his plan a broad swath of American households could also see  a very small increase in their taxes.</p><p>This is due to a number of factors, such as Biden’s proposed corporate tax hike. Many models assume at least part of that burden would be borne by lower-wage workers. But according to an analysis by the independent nonprofit <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/joe-biden-tax-plan-2020/" target="_blank">Tax Policy Foundation</a>, 93% of the increases would be shouldered by the top quintile of taxpayers.</p><p>According to that analysis, that would mean the middle-income quintile (those with income between about $52,000 and $93,000) would experience an average tax increase of $260 per year. Taxpayers in the bottom quintile (those with income less than $26,000) would see an average tax increase of only $30.</p><p>Biden has also said he would reinstate the individual mandate -- the penalty for not having health insurance created by the Affordable Care Act -- that was eliminated by the 2017 tax cuts.</p><p>However, Biden says he also aims to reduce some taxes. He said he would repeal the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction instituted by the 2017 bill, which primarily impacts high-income households in areas with high state taxes, like California and New York.</p><p>He also plans to offer tax credits aimed at accomplishing different policy goals -- such as reinstating or expanding incentives intended to reduce carbon emissions and helping low- and middle-income families offset the costs of home buying.</p><p><em>--Shannon Crawford and Beatrice Peterson</em></p><div><aside class="InlineElement InlineElement--desktop InlineImage"><div class="ScrollSpy_container"><span></span></div><figure class="Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image"><div class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></div><div class="Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative"><picture><source srcSet="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" media="(max-width: 767px)"/><source srcSet="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" media="(max-width: 413px)"/><img class="" alt="PHOTO: Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen.

Harris was the "most liberal" of her Senate colleagues in a <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/kamala_harris/412678/report-card/2019" target="_blank">2019 survey</a>, which compared the number of bipartisan bills a senator co-sponsored to the total number of bills he or she signed onto. Harris had the smallest percent of bipartisan bills in 2019,  making her the most-liberal senator by this metric.</p><p>Harris certainly has one of the more liberal voting records in the Senate: She has voted to increase gun control and block conservative judicial nominees, for instance.</p><p>But there are nuances that the organization's founder, Josh Tauberer, said GovTrack's model doesn't account for, like the complexity of Harris' political views, the distinctions between different wings within each major political party, the specific approach Harris might take to achieve her desired outcome, or the unwillingness of Republicans to work with Harris during a presidential year.</p><p><em>--Allison Pecorin</em></p><h3>Pence peddles discredited claim that universal mail-in voting leads to massive fraud</h3><p>PENCE'S CLAIM: "President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail-in voting that will create a massive opportunity for voter fraud."</p><p>FACT CHECK: Pence echoed Trump’s attempts to cast doubt on the widespread embrace of vote-by-mail across the country this election by suggesting that universal mail-in voting could lead to massive fraud.</p><p>That is historically not true.</p><p>Kim Wyman, the Republican secretary of state in Washington -- a state that adopted statewide mail voting in 2011 -- <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/mail-in-vote-fraud-ballot.html" target="_blank">told The New York Times</a> in June that while any voting method could potentially be susceptible to fraud, in her experience as the chief elections official in the state, fraud with mail ballots is low.</p><p>"How do you respond to someone that makes an allegation that there's rampant fraud?" she said. "You show them all the security measures that are in place to prevent it and detect it if it does happen."</p><p>Ben Ginsberg, a Republican election guru who has spent years looking for voter fraud, wrote in a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/08/republicans-have-insufficient-evidence-call-elections-rigged-fraudulent" target="_blank">Washington Post op-ed</a>, "Four decades of dedicated investigation have produced only isolated incidents of election fraud."</p><p>"These are painful conclusions for me to reach. Before retiring from law practice last month, I spent 38 years in the GOP’s legal trenches. I was part of the 1990s redistricting that ended 40 years of Democratic control and brought 30 years of GOP successes in Congress and state legislatures. I played a central role in the 2000 Florida recount and several dozen Senate, House and state contests," he wrote.
