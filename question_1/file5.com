They would not only help eliminate wealth differences caused by systemic racism, but are also "a form of compensation that would amount to healing," William "Sandy" Darity, an economist and professor at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy told ABC News.</p><p>The topic is controversial. While arguments have been made that reparations to Black descendants of enslaved people could help restore economic balance in the nation, there is the outstanding question of how much should be paid out and to whom.</p><p>So what exactly is owed? That depends on which economic expert you ask.</p><h3>Calculating reparations</h3><p>Darity and co-author Andrea Kirsten Mullen have a new book, "From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century," that analyzes past estimates for reparation amounts and offers new ones.</p><p>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign economist Larry Neal estimated in 1983 that America owed $1.4 trillion in reparations for Black descendants of enslaved people. Neal based this figure on the amount of wages earned by non-enslaved workers between 1620 and 1840, subtracting costs related to the care of slaves (food, housing, care, etc.).</p><p>According to Darity and Mullen, that 1983 figure compounded at 4%, 5% and 6% interest by 2019, would be $5.7 trillion, $8.1 trillion and $11.4 trillion, respectively, as per their calculations.</p><p>They also suggest there was a major flaw with Neal's calculation: it doesn't take into account the 20 years before the Civil War.</p><p>Roger Ransom, a former economics professor at the University of Virginia and the University of California, and Richard Sutch, who was a professor emeritus of economics at the University of California, before his death in 2019, based their calculation on the profit from slavery between 1806 and 1860. Their method, compounded at interest rates of 4%, 5% and 6% in 2018, would amount to $14 billion, $19.7 billion, and $27.7 billion, Darity and Mullen figured. But they also cited flaws with Ransom and Sutch's methodology. They argue that the calculation doesn't account for the first 30 years of slavery in the country, it omits profit  from the slave trade, and charges the enslaved for their own maintenance costs, resulting in "the lowest bill for black reparations among those we examine," Darity and Mullen write in their book.</p><p>One of the more complex calculations is by Thomas Craemer, a professor of public policy at the University of Connecticut. He multiplied the "prevailing market wage" by the number of hours enslaved people worked (assuming a 24-hour work day) between the years 1776 and 1865. That model, calculated for 2019 at 4%, 5% and 6% interest rates, works out to $16.4 trillion, $17 trillion and $17.7 trillion, respectively.</p><p>The problem with Craemer's calculation, according to Darity and Mullen, is that it relies on "the market wage for non-slave labor" rather than "the hypothetical non-slave labor wage that would have prevailed in the absence of captive enslaved Africans." This yields a slightly lower calculation as per Darity and Mullen.</p><div><div class="CalloutLink"><div class="CalloutLink-item"><span><svg class="icon__svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><use xlink:href="#icon__plus"></use></svg></span><a class="AnchorLink CalloutLink-text" tabindex="0" data-track-moduleofclick="Callout" data-track-position="5" data-track-ctatext="MORE-Controversial-group-ADOS-divides-black-Americans-in-fight-for-economic-equality" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/controversial-group-ados-divides-black-americans-fight-economic/story?id=66832680">MORE: Controversial group ADOS divides black Americans in fight for economic equality</a></div></div></div><p>Therefore, Darity and Mullen came up with their own calculation based on net worth. They cite the gap in mean household wealth by race, which was $795,000, according to the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances.</p><p>"If the average black household consists of 3.31 persons," Darity and Mullen write in their book, "the mean shortfall in wealth for individual black Americans would have been approximately $240,000."</p><p>Next, they multiplied $795,000 by the U.S. Census Bureau's estimate of 10 million Black households, arriving at a reparations bill of $7.95 trillion.</p><p>They also offer an alternative calculation. The Black population comprises about 13% of the American population. The nation's total household wealth reached $107 trillion by the second quarter of 2018.

"Therefore, the federal government has a responsibility of paying that back."</p><p>"The policies that facilitated slavery were at fault," Perry added. "The damage was caused by policy failure. Policies should drive the remedy."</p><p>Looking abroad, despite many of the individual perpetrators of the Holocaust being long gone, Germany has paid out <a href="https://apnews.com/e65144a995d743438634e80bf556f92e" target="_blank">billions of dollars to survivors</a>, their families and eligible heirs.</p><p>Perry also noted that there are historical precedents for the U.S. federal government compensating victims of its past mistakes, and so-called "reparations" have happened before, just not for Black Americans.</p><p>Through the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, the government admitted to a litany of wrongdoings in its internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. As part of a reparations package, the government paid $20,000 to every living survivor of the internment camps and <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title50-section4202&num=0&edition=prelim" target="_blank">issued an apology</a> that acknowledged a "grave injustice" that was "motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership." In total, $1.6 billion was paid out to more than 82,250 eligible claimants. Adjusted for inflation, that figure would top $3.5 billion in 2020.</p><div><aside class="InlineElement InlineElement--desktop InlineImage"><div class="ScrollSpy_container"><span></span></div><figure class="Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image"><div class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></div><div class="Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative"><picture><source srcSet="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" media="(max-width: 767px)"/><source srcSet="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" media="(max-width: 413px)"/><img class="" alt="PHOTO: Japanese people lining up for registration at the Alien Reception Center, Manzanar, Calif., March 27, 1942." data-mptype="image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></picture></div><figcaption><div class="Caption__Wrapper"><div class="Caption"><div class="Caption__Meta Caption__Meta--flex"><img class="Image Logo Caption__Logo Logo__xs" alt="Bettmann Archive/Getty Images, FILE" data-mptype="image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/><span class="RichText Caption__Meta__Text">Bettmann Archive/Getty Images, FILE</span></div><div class="Caption__TextWrapper"><div class="Caption__Text" aria-labelledby="Caption__ScreenReaderText"><span class="Truncate Truncate--collapsed"><span><span class="RichText">Japanese people lining up for registration at the Alien Reception Center, Manzanar, Calif., March 27, 1942.</span></span></span></div></div><span id="Caption__ScreenReaderText" aria-hidden="true">Japanese people lining up for registration at the Alien Reception Center, Manzanar, Calif., March 27, 1942.</span></div></div></figcaption></figure></aside></div><p>Nkechi Taifa, a lawyer and reparations advocate with the National African American Reparations Commission (NAARC), told ABC News that when that bill was passed, "it came from taxpayer dollars."</p><p>"I had nothing to do with the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/photos/back-japanese-internment-camps-us-75-years-45619691/image-45619857">internment of Japanese Americans</a> during World War II," she said.

"They weren't paid to the formerly enslaved people. They weren't paid to the victims, they were paid to the slave owners for the loss of their property."</p><p>President Abraham Lincoln's emancipation bill in 1862 provided payment to slave owners up to <a href="https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/dc-emancipation-act" target="_blank">$300 for each enslaved person</a> who was freed. Adjusted for inflation, that figure would be approximately $8,000.</p><p>There has been a history of pushback for reparations at the federal level.</p><p>Black Republicans like Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina are not in favor of reparations, but instead, favor policies like opportunity zones. On his website, Scott claims opportunity zones are incentives that aim to "lift entire communities out of poverty by attracting private dollars to the corners of our country that have been left behind as the American economy has surged forward."</p><p>Black Democrats have also been skeptical of reparations including Rep. Clyburn, who said in an interview with the <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/scs-clyburn-pans-reparations-opportunity-zones-as-unable-to-address-racial-inequality/article_3bb2e8ba-3eb3-11e9-b75a-a376c84be23f.html" target="_blank">Post and Courier</a>, that reparations would be "difficult to implement."</p><p>And some have argued that social programs like Medicaid, Social Security and other welfare benefits are a form of reparations, while not specifically targeted at Black people, write Darity and Mullen in their book.</p><p>Taifa called all the arguments for why the federal government shouldn't pay reparations now, because of cost, logistical difficulties or the amount of time that has passed: "hogwash."</p><p>"I say that because whose fault is it that this much time has passed that has not been addressed?" she said. "The demand for reparations has been going on ever since the enslavement era."</p><p>Perry added that historically in the U.S, "when there's white suffering, we find the money."</p><p>"We will sell debt, we will do a number of things to find the revenue," he added.</p><p>Taifa cited how Congress rallied some $2 trillion extremely quickly in the CARES Act to respond to the COVID-19 crisis as an example of how lawmakers are able to find the money when they need to.</p><p>At the local level, one city has found a creative way of raising reparations funds. Evanston, Illinois <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/evanston-illinois-finds-innovative-solution-funding-reparations-marijuana/story?id=71826707" target="_blank">said earlier this year</a> that it plans to use the $10 million collected by the city in legal marijuana sales to provide Black residents with housing and economic development benefits.</p><p>Ultimately, Perry said he doesn't think the issue is a matter of where the money will come from, but rather, "it's about political will."</p><p>"We shouldn't prohibit policy simply because it's hard to implement," he said. "They said the same thing about integration, about women's rights -- that it's too hard, that the culture won't allow it, that the blowback will be too severe."</p><p>"Resistance is more about ignorance," he said. "Not about facts."</p><p>Darity and Mullen in their book state, "The invoice [for reparations] should go directly to the U.S. Congress."</p><p>"The culpable party," Darity said bluntly, "is the United States government."</p><p>Darity and Mullen also propose in their book several ways the federal government could fund reparations without imposing new taxes. One way, they discuss is by funding through deficit spending.</p><p>Deficit spending -- defined as the government spending more than it collects -- Darity and Mullen write, would require no change in tax rates, and if reparations provide a stimulus, could actually generate a tax revenue to fund the program.</p><p>They also suggest that the Federal Reserve could fund reparations in much the same way it funded investment banks during the Great Recession.</p><p>Because of the bailout by the Federal Reserve, Darity and Mullen make the argument that "there can be no doubt that the Fed has vast capacity to provide the funds required for a properly designed and financed reparations program."</p><h3>Private sector</h3><p>Meanwhile, as increasing evidence emerges of private sector culpability or complacency in the slave trade, many are also calling on these entities which still exist today to pay reparations.</p><p>A slew of banks, life insurance companies and even universities have been thrust into the spotlight recently after evidence emerged they were involved in the slave trade.</p><p>Georgetown University admitted in recent years to selling 272 slaves in 1838 to pay off debts and ultimately keep the school open. In 2019, the private university announced the creation of a fund it said could generate $400,000 a year in scholarships to benefit <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/georgetown-university-announces-reparations-fund-benefit-descendants-slaves/story?id=66642286" target="_blank">the descendants of these people</a>.</p><p>In 2005, JPMorgan Chase admitted that two of its predecessor banks in Louisiana had links to the slave trade, <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6851727/ns/business-us_business/t/jpmorgan-predecessors-linked-slavery/#.X2nfqZ5Kjxt" target="_blank">The Associated Press reported</a>. The investment banking giant issued an apology and set up a scholarship fund for Black students from the state.</p><p>Taifa said she has been fighting for entities that "were culpable and benefited unjustly" from the slave trade era to "come up with a settlement or negotiation."</p><p>Earlier this year, the nation's wealthiest Black man, billionaire <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/billionaire-philanthropist-shocks-morehouse-grads-promising-pay-off/story?id=63137376">Robert Smith</a> called on companies that profited off the slave trade to consider paying reparations.</p><div><div class="CalloutLink"><div class="CalloutLink-item"><span><svg class="icon__svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><use xlink:href="#icon__plus"></use></svg></span><a class="AnchorLink CalloutLink-text" tabindex="0" data-track-moduleofclick="Callout" data-track-position="9" data-track-ctatext="MORE-Billionaire-philanthropist-Robert-Smith-shocks-Morehouse-grads-by-promising-to-pay-off-loans" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/billionaire-philanthropist-shocks-morehouse-grads-promising-pay-off/story?id=63137376">MORE: Billionaire philanthropist Robert Smith shocks Morehouse grads by promising to pay off loans</a></div></div></div><p>"I think corporations have to also think about, well, what is the right thing to do?" he told Reuters.</p><h3>What should 'reparations' look like?</h3><p>Proposals for what reparations should look like vary widely. Many advocates are calling for direct payments, others are arguing for tax cuts, and some say they should come in the form of investments in Black communities, scholarship funds or other collective investments.</p><p>The HR 40 bill that was introduced in the House last year by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Tex., calls for the creation of a commission to study and develop reparation proposals. Senator Cory Booker, D-NJ, introduced a partner bill in the Senate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pelosi-says-she-supports-forming-commission-to-consider-reparations-for-slavery" target="_blank">expressed her support for the bill</a> during at an event at Howard University last year. The late Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., first proposed the bill that would become H.R. 40 in 1989.</p><div><aside class="InlineElement InlineElement--desktop InlineImage"><div class="ScrollSpy_container"><span></span></div><figure class="Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image"><div class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></div><div class="Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative"><picture><source srcSet="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" media="(max-width: 767px)"/><source srcSet="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" media="(max-width: 413px)"/><img class="" alt="PHOTO: In this June 19, 2019, file photo, Rep.

"The harm was multifaceted and the relief should be as well."</p><p>Perry added that as an economist he thinks the "most prominent form of reparations should come in the form of a check."</p><p>"This is about a debt that is owed," he said. "This about compensating for labor and damage, so it should come into the form of a check" to descendants of enslaved people.</p><p>In their book, Darity and Mullen also suggest direct payments and said they could be disbursed over time. They also suggest "a portfolio of reparations" which could be trust funds available for eligible Black Americans to apply for grants for homeownership, education, establishing businesses or purchasing financial assets.</p><p>Some localities are also "trying to figure out ways how they can create policies that address the policy violence inflicted on Black Americans over the over the course of centuries," Perry said.</p><p>"So, it might come in the form of investments in Black communities, new zoning practices, educational scholarships, business loans," he said.</p><p>Most importantly, to Taifa, reparations can "go a long way toward the racial healing that we need, the closing of a shameful chapter in this history and also the allowance for the victims themselves, those parties, to decide just what they want."</p><p>"When I say 'they,' I'm talking about we, Black people, really want as a future here, a political future, economic future, a cultural future in the light," Taifa
