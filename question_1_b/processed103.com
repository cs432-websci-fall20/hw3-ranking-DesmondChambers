Two of the largest wildfires in California's history, the LNU and SCU Lightning Complexes, are now 100% contained after burning for more than two months. The August Complex Fire, the largest in state history, is nearing 1 million acres burned and is 47% contained.
Cal Fire has arrested 68 people on arson charges this year, 46 of whom started wildland fires, the agency announced Thursday.
More than 8,100 wildfires have burned over 3.9 million acres across California this year, killing 30 people and destroying more than 7,500 structures. Enough containment lines have been put in by state fire crews to reach from San Diego to New York City, Cal Fire Chief Thom Porter told reporters on Thursday.
"Every acre in California can and will burn some day," Porter said. "We need to embrace that and become resilient to it."
While this season rivals the Great Fire of 1910, when more than 3 million acres burned, the difference today is that 30 million people live in the state, Porter said.
"There isn't a fire that we're going to have that isn't going to impact people at some point in the near future," he added.
