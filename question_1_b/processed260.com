Robinson's cause of death is unknown at this time.
The former player from Buffalo, New York, was drafted out of the University of Connecticut to play for the Portland Trail Blazers in 1989 and was a critical player for the eight seasons he played there.
"He was our first great player... he came from a difficult background in Buffalo, I watched him evolve as a man... he was a good man, had a great career, and was instrumental in a lot of the great things that happened at UConn," former Huskies coach Jim Calhoun told David Borges of Hearst Connecticut Media.
