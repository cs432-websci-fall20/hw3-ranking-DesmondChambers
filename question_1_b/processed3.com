When Jaynes Andredes arrived at her new job at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, she stepped foot into a familiar place, but with a very different role.
On Sept. 28, Andredes took to Facebook to proudly share her decadelong journey from working as a janitor to a newly hired nurse practitioner at the same hospital.
"I learned as a custodian that every part of the hospital and every person who works in the hospital is important," Andredes told "World News Tonight."
