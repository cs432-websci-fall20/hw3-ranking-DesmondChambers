Asma Elbadawi (@asmaelbadawi)
Occupation: Basketballer, Poet and Campaigner
There are countless strings to Asma’s bow, not least a successful campaign to overturn the rule that women cannot compete in professional basketball while wearing the hijab , and her spoken word poetry.
“At school, there were two types of girls: the sporty ones and those who wore make-up. I want to show the younger generation that there’s no one ideal of what an athletic woman looks like.” Asma also uses her platform to openly share other challenges she’s faced too, such as her recovery from an eating disorder . “I’m growing alongside my followers.”

Jesy Nelson (@jesynelson)
Occupation: Entertainer
Alongside making up a quarter of the world’s biggest girlband, Little Mix , Jesy also champions issues close to her heart, notably through her Instagram posts and an award-winning documentary, Odd One Out . The programme saw her speak candidly about body image and trolling, drawing upon her personal experiences of unfairly being branded the “ugly one” of the group. Now, she’s passionate about keeping her profile ‘real’ to guide others through their down days.
“I can’t lie, sometimes I’m guilty of posting a glamorous selfie but then I think ‘You’ve got to switch it up a bit and post stuff on there where you look a bit shit too’,” she says. Offline, Jesy is proud to be a listening ear to her friends and practices self-love . “A friend messaged me the other day, basically slating herself and I said, ‘Why do we think it’s okay to talk about ourselves in that way? It’s basically bullying yourself’.” Her advice? “I know it’s cringe and cheesy, but you have to look in the mirror and instead of picking yourself apart, say what you like about yourself instead.”

Tanya Compas (@tanyacompas)
Occupation: Youth Worker and Advocate
Not only does Tanya’s virtual world shine a spotlight on LGBTQ+ folk and those from minority backgrounds, but she also creates spaces for her online army to meet in real life too, with events such as Queer Black Christmas. For Tanya, social media is all about community, as it’s where she first found friends when exploring her identity as a queer person of colour .
“Look for club nights and events, as well as talking to people online. Use them as an olive branch to suggest meeting in person.” If you’re stuck on where to start when it comes to finding your own tribe, the award-winning youth worker advises sniffing out the bigger platforms related to what you’re interested in, then taking a look at who they’re following too. “Be visible, be unapologetic.”

Jaz O’Hara (@theworldwidetribe)
Occupation: Founder of The Worldwide Tribe
After her Facebook post, documenting the incredible human spirit and tough living conditions she’d seen while visiting The Jungle (a refugee camp in France) went viral in 2015, Jaz wanted to give others a voice. She created The Worldwide Tribe, a storytelling organisation, to do exactly that – with the aim of humanising migrants , uniting nations and raising awareness.
“I love following other uplifting Instagram accounts too, such as @DoSomethingForNothing, which showcases endless examples of local do-gooders, like barbers who cut homeless people’s hair for free,” says Jaz. “It’s empowering to be positive in the face of adversity.” She’s also taken her work offline and speaks at largescale events, including those with Amnesty, and hosts a podcast called – you've guessed it – The Worldwide Tribe.

Mikaela Loach (@mikaelaloach)
Occupation: Student and Climate Change Activist
Not only does spreading the word about environment issues get Mikaela, an Extinction Rebellion member , fired up, but she’s dedicated to making activism more inclusive. “My passion was born from frustration,” she explains. “To me positivity doesn’t mean having blind optimism, but rather investing your time in whatever brings you down and trying to make a difference.” For this eco warrior , who calls out the discrepancies in media reporting towards non-white activists, being part of a movement is the best way to feel better about the world. “Follow people online who aren’t like you, it’s where you’ll learn the most, by hearing others’ stories.”

Laurie Nunn (@laurienunn)
Occupation: Writer
The creator of Netflix’s Sex Education has certainly done more in the last few months to make us smile than anyone else we can think of. Famed for its super diverse cast and comedically relatable approach to sex and relationships (we only wish we could’ve learnt about consent , gender labels and the importance of boundaries in our own biology lessons), Laurie has created something truly magical.
"I find all writing cathartic in a way, as it usually comes from a personal place. But Sex Education has been particularly enlightening – it's made me learn so much about my own wants, needs and desires as a woman," she says. "Through researching the show, I learn new things about sex and relationships every day. I now understand for the first time how important it is that society tries to encourage more open, honest conversations about those topics, with people of all ages. Even though it’s an awkward subject matter, the more accurate information young people are given about how to ask for what they want and set clear boundaries in their sexual relationships, the healthier humans they'll be – that can only be a good thing."
Laurie has her head very much screwed on when it comes to social media too. “I try and follow organisations and people who use Instagram in a positive and educational way, but I also follow a lot of dog Instagram account. Dogs never fail to make me happy.” Wise words, if ever we heard them.
Clara Amfo (@claraamfo)
Occupation: Broadcaster and Presenter
Arguably the most smiley human in entertainment today, Clara’s enigmatic personality has more than earned her a place on The Positivity Index. She brings a warmth to social media by making sure all her posts are genuinely useful and informative. “I try to go beyond showing people what I’m wearing and also share insights into what I'm doing workwise,” she says. “I love getting glammed up , but there’s more to life than that.”
There’s also her hilarious "secret" second Instagram account (@whatsappmama), dedicated solely to WhatsApp screenshots of conversations with her mum – who remains thoroughly unimpressed by Clara's life in the public eye. “She’s the true star of the family,” she says.
On positivity in general, Clara views it as a mindset. "Sometimes you have to work for it, but to me it's about finding useful and progressive solutions in any situation. For example if you're off sick but are wishing you could be back at work or out with friends, don't get down about it – acknowledge that you're listening to your body and putting yourself first." Surrounding yourself with people who tell the truth and champion you is key too, she says. "I cheerlead them right back."
