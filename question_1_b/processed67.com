Joe Biden's campaign has ramped up the pace of his virtual fundraisers and events as "Operation MAGA" kicks into high gear in the final weeks before Election Day.
Several upcoming key events will feature Dr. Jill Biden, Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. and Harris's husband, Doug Emhoff.
In the last few weeks, Harris has been joining her events, virtually, from a sophisticated and savvy studio built for her and her team at her alma mater, Howard University, in downtown Washington, D.C.

Upcoming events will also feature former 2020 candidates and their spouses, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., and her husband  Bruce Mann, and other notable Democrats, celebrities and supporters.
Biden, the Democratic National Committee and affiliated joint fundraising committees entered the month of September with $466 million in hand. That total was well over $140 million more than President Donald Trump, the Republican National Committee and affiliated joint fundraising committees had at the time.
Now, the Biden campaign is planning to host 53 fundraisers over 14 days, with seven events happening on Oct. 6 and seven happening on Oct. 8.

The Biden campaign has relied heavily on virtual meetings and fundraisers since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas Trump's team had been holding in-person events more regularly with surrogates and campaign leaders across the country.

With the president's recent diagnosis and the outbreak of COVID-19 cases among his White House staff, the Trump campaign is moving forward with virtual and in-person campaign events titled "Operation MAGA" until the president can return to the trail. On Monday, the president assured on Twitter that that day will come "soon."
"Operation MAGA will fire up the entire MAGA universe to keep President Trump's campaign at full speed until our Commander-in-Chief returns to the campaign trail," said Trump 2020 Campaign Manager Bill Stepien. "Vice President Mike Pence, the First Family, our coalitions and our grassroots supporters will be out in full force to show the real enthusiasm behind the president's reelection and to show we're working as hard as he always does."

The plan for the virtual operation effectively started on Sunday while Trump was taking part in his motorcade right outside Walter Reed Medical Center. The Trump campaign simultaneously held a "Call to Prayer" event for the president and first lady Melania Trump.
Trump 2020 Senior Advisor Laura Trump led the call with several faith leaders across the country and thanked those who have prayed for the president and wished him well.
"Donald Trump and our first lady are going to come through this no problem, and it will be because of the power of prayer," she said. "We know it works. And I want to say a big welcome, as well, to all of our incredible faith leaders who have joined us from across America tonight to pray with us, to pray on behalf of our first lady, our president and America."
