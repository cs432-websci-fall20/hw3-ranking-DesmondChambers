When responding officers went into the house, "they were met with gunfire" and the "officers returned gunfire," Harmon said. Three officers were shot, but they are stable and "doing well," Harmon said.
The three officers were identified as Jacqueline Quiles, Cris Hester and Nik Anderson. An internal investigation by Cedar Park Police Department's Professional Standards Division is also underway per department policy, police said.
Following the shootout, the suspect barricaded himself inside the home with his mother, brother and sister. Police had been in contact with him and the others in the house.
After 16 hours, the brother and sister were released Monday morning, Harmon said. By about 9 a.m., the suspect and the last hostage, his mother, came out of the house peacefully, police tweeted.
The Texas Rangers are now leading the investigation into the incident.
