In a new Instagram photo, Katy got decked out in cow print to return to work as a judge on American Idol . The bold ensemble was custom-made by designer Christian Siriano — and complete with a matching hat, fingerless gloves, and heels.

Very fittingly, she also touched on the realities of multitasking as a working mom with having to take pumping breaks on the job, adding, “Not pictured: my pumping breaks 🙃.”

It’s not the first time Katy has been open about her experience with breastfeeding. During this year's virtual VMAs, Katy Perry showed off her postpartum look in a refreshingly candid photo — featuring a nursing bra.

In another recent Instagram post, Katy encouraged fans to register to vote by "exercising that vote" in a funny fitness-themed video she and Orlando starred in with Jane Fonda and other celebs: Amy Schumer, Kerry Washington, Vanessa Hudgens, Ken Jeong, Ashley Benson, and Shaquille O'Neal.

The video included a lighthearted moment of an exhausted Katy breast-pumping, and she threw a few puns in the caption, too: "GET PUMPED TO VOTE!!!" She also added, "Okay so @orlandobloom and I have different views on what it means to get pumped these days 🐄 but whoever said pumping isn’t a sport...I’d like to twist their nipples clockwise for one week straight 🙃 🤪."

Well, I definitely appreciate Katy's sense of humor and all her candidness about mom life!
